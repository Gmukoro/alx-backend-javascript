0x03-ES6_data_manipulation

### Array

- **Definition:** An ordered collection of elements.
- **Usage:** Creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over elements.

### Typed Array

- **Definition:** Arrays that provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data.
- **Usage:** Working with binary data in a type-specific manner (e.g., `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`).

### Set Data Structure

- **Definition:** A collection of unique values.
- **Usage:** Storing unique elements and performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

### Map Data Structure

- **Definition:** A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Usage:** Associating values with keys, retrieving values based on keys, and iterating over key-value pairs.

### WeakMap

- **Definition:** Similar to `Map` but with keys that are weakly referenced.
- **Usage:** Storing key-value pairs where keys can be garbage-collected if there are no other references to them.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- **Map, Filter, and Reduce on Arrays:**

  - **Map:** Creating a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
  - **Filter:** Creating a new array with elements that pass a condition.
  - **Reduce:** Applying a function to accumulate array values into a single result.

- **Typed Arrays:**

  - **Definition and Purpose:** Handling binary data efficiently.
  - **Usage:** Creating and manipulating typed arrays.

- **Set, Map, and Weak Data Structures:**
  - **Set:** Understanding unique collections of values and their operations.
  - **Map:** Associating keys with values and performing CRUD operations.
  - **WeakMap:** Managing key-value pairs with keys that can be garbage-collected.
